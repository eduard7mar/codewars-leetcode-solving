// Build a function that returns an array of integers from n to 1 where n>0.
// Example : n=5 --> [5,4,3,2,1]

// Solution
const reverseSeq = (n) => {
  let arr = [];
  for (let i = n; i > 0; i--) {
    arr.push(i);
  }
  return arr;
};

// A hero is on his way to the castle to complete his mission. However, he's been told that the castle is surrounded with a couple of powerful dragons! each dragon takes 2 bullets to be defeated, our hero has no idea how many bullets he should carry.. Assuming he's gonna grab a specific given number of bullets and move forward to fight another specific given number of dragons, will he survive?
// Return true if yes, false otherwise :)

// Solution
function hero(bullets, dragons) {
  return bullets >= dragons * 2;
}

// Who remembers back to their time in the schoolyard, when girls would take a flower and tear its petals, saying each of the following phrases each time a petal was torn:
// 1.	"I love you"
// 2.	"a little"
// 3.	"a lot"
// 4.	"passionately"
// 5.	"madly"
// 6.	"not at all"
// If there are more than 6 petals, you start over with "I love you" for 7 petals, "a little" for 8 petals and so on.
// When the last petal was torn there were cries of excitement, dreams, surging thoughts and emotions.
// Your goal in this kata is to determine which phrase the girls would say at the last petal for a flower of a given number of petals. The number of petals is always greater than 0.

// Solution
function howMuchILoveYou(nbPetals) {
  let phrases = [
    "I love you",
    "a little",
    "a lot",
    "passionately",
    "madly",
    "not at all",
  ];

// You take your son to the forest to see the monkeys. You know that there are a certain number there (n), but your son is too young to just appreciate the full number, he has to start counting them from 1.
// As a good parent, you will sit and count with him. Given the number (n), populate an array with all numbers up to and including that number, but excluding zero.
// For example(Input --> Output):
// 10 --> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
// 1 --> [1]

// Solution
function monkeyCount(n) {
  let array = [];
  let i = 0;
  while (i < n) {
    i++;
    array.push(i);
  }
  return array;
